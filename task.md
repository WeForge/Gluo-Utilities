I need a bot for the management discord (hosted) that has a /bug-report command which will prompt a modal asking for a quick/short explanation of the bug, then it will create a channel under a category I can specify. the channel will hold the name: `bug-{INCREMENTAL_ID}`, the user that ran the function should be added to the channel. then there should also be a log channel in which a message should be sent holding the short description, a link to the active channel and a button to mark it as solved (this button needs a role to be pressed). when a bug thread is solved it should close the channel and update the embed to clearly show it was solved.

ideally there would also be some kind of similar feature for this discord. you would also be able to do /bug-report however it should still create the channel in the management server but there should be a portal in place that allows us in the management server to communicate with the person here. (it should also be appended to the log)

possible?
